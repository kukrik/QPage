QPage
=====

The QPage plugin for QCubed extends QForm to handle the entire document output.
This allows for control of page title, description, etc from within QControls.
Also, CSS files will be appended to `<head>` rather than prepended to the `<form>` producing valid output.
Easily change the doctype and elements will render valid against the chosen doctype. Defaults to HTML5.
